# Develop

## Overview

This section describes how to generate the patterns, how to train the NN, and how to include the updates into the HLS source code and the emulator code. It also describes how to make the rate and efficiency plots.

Most of the tasks here are done with Python + Jupyter. A Conda environment is used to manage the Python packages. The ML framework of choice is TensorFlow.

If you are not familiar with Jupyter, please look at:

If you are not familiar with Conda, please look at:
